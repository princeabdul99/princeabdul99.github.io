  description: "This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a production-grade, 
                end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
                The pipeline ingests raw data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), 
                processes it through a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) using BigQuery, 
                and delivers analytics-ready datasets visualized in Looker Studio.

                The solution is fully automated, containerized, and orchestrated with Apache Airflow, 
                reflecting real-world data engineering best practices around scalability, reliability, 
                and analytics performance."

  description: "Architected and implemented an automated data pipeline to
                extract raw data from AWS S3, ingest into Snowflake, and
                transform it into optimized reporting models. This enabled
                real-time analytics, reduced data latency, and ensured high data
                quality across countries."
